k-nearest neighbor algorithm:

This algorithm is used to solve the classification model problems. K-nearest neighbor or K-NN algorithm basically creates an imaginary boundary to classify the data. When new data points come in, the algorithm will try to predict that to the nearest of the boundary line.

Therefore, larger k value means smother curves of separation resulting in less complex models. Whereas, smaller k value tends to overfit the data and resulting in complex models.

Note: Itâ€™s very important to have the right k-value when analyzing the dataset to avoid overfitting and underfitting of the dataset.

Using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm we fit the historical data (or train the model) and predict the future.
